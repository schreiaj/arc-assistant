# FRC Assistant

This is an attempt to help share that institutional knowledge that most veteran FRC teams have with other teams. It's set up as an interactive fiction for folks to walk through to help guide them to what resources will help them.

Content is written in [Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md) I've tried to break major subsystems into unique files linked into the main ink file. I've done most of the writing in [Inky](https://github.com/inkle/inky). To publish overwrite the FRC Assistant.js file using the _Export story.js only..._ option.
